# VPS Providers: Independent Alternatives

A comprehensive guide to VPS providers that are **not** Google, Amazon, or Microsoft.

## Why Avoid Big Tech Infrastructure?

### Privacy Concerns
- Google/Amazon/Microsoft can access your data
- Subject to US jurisdiction and data requests
- Used for AI training and analytics
- Terms of service can change

### Independence
- Support smaller, independent providers
- Reduce centralisation of internet infrastructure
- Often better value for money
- More transparent practices

## Truly Independent Providers

These providers **own and operate their own data centres** and do not use AWS/GCP/Azure infrastructure.

## Verification: Is Your Provider Independent?

### Check 1: Company Ownership
- Look up the company on Wikipedia
- Check their "About Us" page
- Independent means not owned by Google/Amazon/Microsoft

### Check 2: Data Centre Ownership
- Do they own their data centres?
- Or do they lease from big tech?
- Good providers are transparent about this

### Check 3: Network Tests
```bash
# Traceroute to your VPS
traceroute your-vps-ip

# Check AS number
whois your-vps-ip | grep -i "origin"

# Independent providers have their own AS numbers
# AWS: AS16509, AS14618
# GCP: AS15169, AS396982
# Azure: AS8075
```

### Check 4: DNS Records
```bash
# Should not resolve to big tech domains
dig your-vps.provider.com

# Bad: *.amazonaws.com, *.googleusercontent.com
# Good: *.hetzner.com, *.ovh.net, *.fasthosts.co.uk
```
